# Learning

So, learning is a significant aspect of a person to grow as a person as well as enhancing skills and ability. So few day earlier, after reading a book called "Ultralearning" by Scott Young, change by whole perspective how we should learn in a very efficent way. So I am started learning from scratch from creating a strong fundamental to finding my weakness. This respository will holds notebooks, codes with explanation which will also include self-explanation as if I will be teaching myself.

## Structure:

Category: Category will be broder topic. Ex. Statistics, Machine Learning, Data Analysis.
Sub-Category: Sub-category will be segmented fields of broader category. Ex. Descriptive Statistics, Statistical Machine Learning, Pandas, Numpy

Under the sub-category, there will be Jupyter Notebooks or Code file related to the learning


Currently, my main focus to become highly skilled in Data Science and Data Engineering which I have good amount of working experience. In future, hopefully the learning will grow into more interesting fields.


### Ultralearning Summary:
[Reference](https://summaries.com/blog/ultralearning). This reference summary will help to remind me about learning process and keep everything fresh.

Principle #1 — Metalearning — Draw a map first. Start any ultralearning project by learning what is the most effective way to learn the subject or acquire the skill you're after. Figure out how to learn efficiently.

Principle #2 — Focus — Sharpen your knife. Carve out chunks of time where you can concentrate and focus on what you're trying to learn consistently well.

Principle #3 — Directness — Go straight ahead. Learn by doing the things you're trying to become good at. Don't trade hands-on experience for other more convenient alternatives.

Principle #4 — Drill — Attack your weakest point. Break complex skills into their component parts and then be ruthless about improving your weakest points. Master the component parts and then reassemble them.

Principle #5 — Retrieval — Test to learn. Use the testing process to learn more as you go along. Always test yourself before you feel confident and push yourself to recall information, not just review it.

Principle #6 — Feedback — Don't dodge the punches. Put aside your ego and look for the harshest feedback you can find. Extract the signal from the noise and pay attention to what that feedback highlights you need to learn.

Principle #7 — Retention — Don't fill a leaky bucket. Be aware and understand what you're consistently forgetting and do something about it. Learn to remember things not just for now but forever.

Principle #8 — Intuition — Dig deep first, then build up. Play and explore to develop your intuition and work to understand what you learn. Don't resort to memorization tricks but get to know your subject deeply.

Principle #9 — Experiment — Explore outside your comfort zone. Don't lose sight of the fact you can't become a true master of your subject by following the paths trodden by others. Explore possibilities others have not imagined.
